# LSPDFR-Custom-Pullover
A plugin for LSPDFR to aid in pulling over of suspects. This is built from Traffic Policer, by Albo1125

<b>Full disclosure:</b> I did not write the code for this plugin. This code is taken from a great plugin that enhanced LSPDFR written by Albo1125 called Traffic Policer.

While Traffic Policer is still alive, and maintained in Open Source, a lot of its features have now been replaced with newer plugins. There was one feature I really missed, and that was the ability to correct a bad pullover by the AI. 

Custom Pullover allows just that. Once the suspect comes to a stop, you can then select from 3 options using your hot keys: 

<ul>
<li><b>Mimic me:</b> The car movements will mimic the movements made by your vehicle
<li><b>Follow me:</b> Pull in front and the suspect will follow you to a new location 
<li><b>Custom location:</b> Use the number keys (or what you set in the ini file) to choose a point in front for the suspect to move to
</ul>

While I did this just for myself, to make my LSPDFR experience a little better - some friends have asked for a copy. So with Albo1125's blessing I release this here for anyone not using Traffic Policer and missing this feature to use as well. 

If you want to still use Traffic Policer, feel free to check out the links below, as the community are trying to keep this great mod working in future versions of LSPDFR.
